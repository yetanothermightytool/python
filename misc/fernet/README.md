# create-fernet-files.py Python Script

## Description
This script encrypts a user-provided password using the Fernet encryption from the Python cryptography library. It generates or loads an encryption key, which is used to encrypt the password. The encrypted password is then saved in a binary file.

These files can later be used in scripts to decrypt and utilize the stored password securely.
